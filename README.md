# TO DO - APP

This is simple ToDo-application which was school assignment @ Helsinki Business College for JavaScript lessons. Done during first period with 9 weeks studies of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Technologies used

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How the app works

- you can add new tasks to list
- tick them when done (task will be overlined)
- delete task
- remove all tasks
- short alert will be shown when some action is done

## What learned and how to improve

This project thought me a lot of Javascript syntax as it was first program I coded myself. Lots of tutorials and googled pages were used too build it up. I also learned a lot of HTML and CSS as project was built from scratch.

Local storage could be used to store the data, or some simple list structure. Code could be cleaned and I am sure there is some beginer's simple mistakes.
